			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Hi, I'm Robin. I have spent almost a decade teaching maths and economics in Bristol,
				and have recently upskilled myself to move into full staack software development.
				I have just finished studying on the <a href="https://io-academy.uk/courses/full-stack-track/"
					target="_blank" class="full-stack-track-link">iO Academy Full Stack Track</a> bootcamp. I love
				learning new things and staying active, and I have lots of hobbies that involve both of those things.
				In particular I do lots of climbing and running, and I play footbal every week. I also love doing
				puzzles
				and mixing Techno on my home DJ setup, and I have even played music in clubs and festivals over the
				years.

							<p>In this project, I used PHP and mySQL queries to create a website that displayed a
								collection
								of dreams from a database. I also included funcitonality to add and remove dreams from
								the
								database using an HTML form which was securely sent with POST requests, PHP functions
								which
								sanitised and validated the input data, and ensured the site was resilient against SQL
								injection. The project was unit tested with PHP unit.
